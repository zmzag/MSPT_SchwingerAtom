# MSPT_SchwingerAtom
Applying multi-scale perturbation theory techniques to 1+1d QED problems

msptnumerics.nb - This script will take in a steady state soliton for a Schwinger atom problem, find the corresponding bound and scattering meson modes of the
system, at quadratic order, and use this to calculate the lowest order corrections to the field operators, calculated using MSPT.  Then, it calculates and 
plots various matrix elements, expectation values, and correlation functions as well as the energy shifts.
